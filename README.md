## What I learned in this project:

* How to use 'useRef' for DOM (Ex:input field).
* U can also use 'useRef' to maintain variables across re-render.
* How to use 'fowardRef' for passing reference to custom components .
* How to use 'useImperativeHandle' for creating custom methods of components(refs), so that u don't need to change the parent's code when child content change.
* The reason why do u need 'Portal'.
